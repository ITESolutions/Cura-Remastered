# Cura-Remastered
The second build of a PHP/MySQL web application (HTML 5/CSS 3). Cura is a small business management app that is developed to be open source and eventually, community maintained.

(I'm new to versioning, sorry)

Cura allows small businesses to work with the efficiency of the corperations. the need for this software arose during my own time as a small business owner and freelance web developer. Cura's purpose is to automate record keeping so that even a single individual can focus on business and run a company without losing time with friends and family.
